## Areas We'd Love Help With

- **Slide Templates** — New layouts, compositions, and visual styles
- **Device Frames** — New device types or improved CSS frames
- **AI Prompts** — Better headline generation, smarter ordering
- **Export Quality** — Sharper renders, edge case fixes
- **Multi-Language** — New locale support, translation improvements
- **Accessibility** — Keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Documentation** — Guides, examples, video tutorials

## Submitting a Gallery Template

The [gallery](https://storeshots.app/gallery) is a community collection of
starting designs. A submission is a **sanitized template** — your colours, copy,
layout, and font. Uploaded screenshots, app icon, custom font, and AI
credentials are stripped; **no binary assets are committed**. Images travel as
hosted URLs instead, so the repo stays small.

1. In the editor, build a design you're happy with.
2. Host a preview image somewhere public (your CDN, GitHub, etc.) and copy its
   URL — this is the main image shown on your gallery card.
3. Open the project menu → **Share to gallery**, paste the preview image URL,
   add your name and a few tags, then **Download template**. The downloaded
   `<slug>.template.json` already has everything private removed.
4. Add it at `app/gallery/<slug>/template.json` (folder name must match `slug`).
5. Run `node scripts/validate-gallery.mjs` to check it, then open a PR.

Optional: to ship demo screenshots with the template, set the device slots to
hosted image URLs (not file uploads) before exporting — only `http(s)` image
URLs survive sanitization. For these to export cleanly from the editor later,
serve them with permissive CORS (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`).

CI runs the same validation on every PR that touches `app/gallery/**`. Cards
with no preview image fall back to a live palette + headline preview.

## Code Style

- **TypeScript** for all `.ts` and `.vue` files
- **Composition API** with `<script setup>` for Vue components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (avoid inline styles when Tailwind classes exist)
- Keep components focused and under 200 lines when possible
